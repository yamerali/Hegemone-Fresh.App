# FRESH.APP
## Bringing Farmers and Their Customers Together!
# Team Hegemone

The Fresh.App brings Farmers and their Customers together. It is the Where, the What, and the When in obtaining fresh farm produce directly from the farm!

The Fresh.App provides a platform for Farmer’s to communicate to their customers not only their road-side stand locations and hours but what produce is for sale on that day and at any particular time during that day.


# Mission Statement

The 100-mile diet is a movement growing in popularity with food enthusiasts. It is where people fill their food basket with only locally grown produce eating only seasonally appropriate and regional foods. Ideally, the practitioner of the diet only eats food that is grown or produced within a 100-mile radius of one’s home. This requires the individual to develop a greater awareness of from where each meal comes.  The major impediment to a successful 100-mile diet is the factor of convenience.
At present, Huron County is home to a diversity of Local Farmers Markets that are enjoyed by visitors and locals. These local markets are only open at set times, usually on weekend mornings, but not all the produce that sold there is locally harvested. For those people trying to fill their food basket with locally grown produce, the local food market might not be the most convenient choice. 
Included in the food landscape are individual farmer’s fruit, and vegetable stands along the road-way at their farm’s gate. These farm gate markets are usually an informal way for local farm families to share some of their extra produce directly with the public.  Often these farm gate fruit and vegetable stands are informal, unmanned and work on the honour system meaning that the produce is paid for by the customer in a secure lock-box.  This provides a customer with some guarantee that the produce is grown locally and the satisfaction of purchasing their food directly from those who grow it. For the farmer, this means that they can sell their produce efficiently to their customers with little overhead and reduce the need to transport their produce to their customers. For those people trying to fill their food basket with locally grown produce and those interested in trying to live the 100 mile diet, the option of road-side farm gate food purchases is appealing. At present, the two main impediments to farm gate food purchases are the distance to drive to the road-side farm gate and the infrequency of available produce for sale due to the informal nature of how road-side farm gate stands are managed. 
The Fresh.App responds directly to the second impediment whereby, the farmer can inform their customers of the variety and availability of produce for sale in real time with live updates.
